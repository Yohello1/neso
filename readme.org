* How to build/Run
We use nix (something) to make sure that everyone has the **exact same** envrioment, and the exact same software. This is so we dont have a 'it works on my computer situation'.
This means that to run our software, you'll need to have nix-shell (I think???) or something like that installed to enter the nix-development envrioment.

So to run it, run these commands
- `nix develop` enter into the development envrioment
- Run whatever commands you need!
